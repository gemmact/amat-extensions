function f = patchEncoding(patch, method, B)
% PATCHENCODING returns an encoding of the pixels contained in a patch.
% 
%   p = PATCHENCODING(patch,method) returns the encoding of the patch
%   according to one of the following methods (default enclosed in 
%   brackets):
% 
%   {'average'} : simple average (returns a 1xC) vector.
%   'hist'      : histogram of the binned values in the patch (returns a
%                 CxB matrix of histograms for each channel, where B is the
%                 number of bins used and is specified by the user as a 3rd
%                 input argument).
% 
%   Patch can be a Nx1 vector where N is the number of the pixels in the 
%   patch (grayscale image), a NxC matrix, where C is the number of the 
%   image channels, or a HxWxC array, where HxW are the dimensions of the 
%   patch.
